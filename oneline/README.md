# Hi

This cog is something that I'd wanted to try for a while, but had no idea how to actually make it work.

After quite a bit of time and research (research lol) I started putting together a very rough version of this cog.

And I'd just like to give some thanks here to some people who've helped me along the way

Epic Guy - The main person pushing me along. A very nice and lovely person to talk to and very knowledgable about weird python shit
Zephyrkul - For helping me with tricking Python into thinking functions were coroutines :^)

## Thanks for reading this, and apologies if you read the source lol
